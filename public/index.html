								Correct payment and collection of sales and use taxes, especially for an organization
								that spans multiple states and taxing jurisdictions, can be a significant challenge for any business.<br>
								<br>
								Complicating factors include the ever-increasing taxation of non-traditional items such as services,
								software and maintenance agreements, to the proper tax calculations, credits or exemptions to claim on
								traditional items such as machinery, equipment and supplies. Other challenges facing tax planners include
								statutory tax refund provisions in lieu of up-front exemptions or the proper calculation of tax offsets to
								apply against sales or use tax audit assessments.<br>

								With over 50 years of multi-state and local tax experience, Brown Taxes’ professionals have the experience
								necessary to effectively minimize state and local tax burdens. Our senior level tax experts work directly with
								clients on every engagement to maintain a high level of personal attention and professionalism often unparalleled
